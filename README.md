# Hyperloop Downtown Los Angeles Station  DTLA-19
Hyperloop is an app that allows walk-up purchases at the Downtown Los Angeles station. This station offers 3 destinations: New York, Portland, and San Francisco. The Hyperloop is set to release in 2030. This app will allow passengers-- those who may have lost their smartphones or those who do not have access to wifi--to easily purchase a Hyperloop Card at the station and add funds to it. Or they can simply pay with cash.
